# The empty brackets are a placeholder for functions. Brendan does not want to go into functions yet,\
# but functions are a better way, rather than repeat for. For example printName("abc"). In some cases there are not\
# brackets, such as student.age.

# What is difference between list.append() and new=list + []. With list append you can append one thing, such as\
# list.append(1) or list.append("b"). If need to \
# add more, use concatenation, the second approach i.e. new=list + [1, 2, 3]
# these actually create new lists with the new values added. The original list still exists in addition to the new one.
