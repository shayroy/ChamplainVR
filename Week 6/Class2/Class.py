""""Object oriented programming is useful in VR/AR. All or almost all modern languages are object oriented.
Any number of objects can be created, based on a blueprint or cookie cutter called a class. Many objects can be created
from the same class. Class names start with capital letter, ie Student. From it, objects such as brendan and vera can be
created. Could be called a software design pattern. Each class represents one thing, ie students, not books, grades or
schools. Atributes or properies describe the student, such as name, height, gender, phone number, program. Registered
is an attribute, while registering them is an method. So methods are actions like register, assign locker, send an
email, create user account. A calculator adds two numbers.
For a class called calculator, number1 and number2 are properties, and adding them is method. The numbers and
 add capacity
are encapsulated within

See slide What is an object (or instance)
brendan= new Student
brendan is an instance (or object) of a Student

Libraries need to deal with book, library, book category, member, borrow book, due date, borrow date.
Classes are Book, Library, Member, BookLoan.
For Book, you can borrow, return, category
For BookLoan, properties are loand date, due date, Book (also a class), Member (also a class).

Not on test for now, but UML (Unified Modelling Language) lists classes in graphical way. It describes how users
interact with objects. Architechs model programming projects this way.

Relationship to VR: Each thing on a screen is an object.

Instantiate means to create an object. See The__init___() function slide.
Upon instantiation, we give values to it. Create a cat but also give it a name.
