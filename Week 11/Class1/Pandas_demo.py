# If you need to analyse large data set, normally will use Pandas, a library for Python. Jupyter is like a
# notebook, showing results of single commands as you execute them. Mathamatica is another. Yuliya showed us how to install
# Jupyter Notebook and a dataset of 10,000 entries. First check if data is good with df.shape (df is data frame). It
#gives 10000 lines in 14 columns. She then asked df.dtypes. It gives the different types of data, ie. Region object,
# Country object, Oder ID int64. She then did df.head(5) (5 prints 5 rows).  Then df.describe(). Gives the stats for
# type of data in standard deviation. df["Region"].value_counts(). (df["Region"]=="Europe").sum().
# Pandas do the analysis, but not the visualization. Brendan will teach as in the book, but add a section or class on
# Pandas.
